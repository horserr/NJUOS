This is NJU operating system's L1.

I wrote the whole project on my own. Sadly, this code couldn't pass the test. It read "double allocation".

Since I don't understand how to debug locally and taking time consumed into consideration, I have to stop and cease. How I wish to could solve this problem by myself!

I left the code here, for you inspiration. There are lots of subtle and complicated ideas right in comment. Hope you can find your way out.
